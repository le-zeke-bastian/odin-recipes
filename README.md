I am completing The Odin Project at the moment and the
project I am about to complete is a test of my current
html abilities. Given that html is just a framework of
a website I can gather it will look pretty bare-bones 
without css and javaScript. The website will a recipe
website that consist of relative and absolute links,
images and various different basic formatting through
simple tags.

    <h2>Crab Cake Recipe Description</h2>
    <p>
        This is a Maryland Steamed Crab Cake recipe with
        instructions for a sauce. No need to steam your
        own live crabs in a pot but do try to get fresh crab meat.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>For the crab cakes</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2½ tablespoons mayonnaise, best quality such as Hellmann's or Duke's</li>
        <li>1½ teaspoons Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Old Bay seasoning</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ cup finely diced celery, from one stalk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1 pound lump crab meat (see note below)</li>
        <li>½ cup panko</li>
        <li>Vegetable or canola oil, for cooking</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the sauce</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup mayonnaise, best quality such as Hellmann's or Duke's</li>
        <li>1½ tablespoons sweet pickle relish</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced red onion</li>
        <li>1-2 tablespoons lemon juice, to taste</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <h4>For the crab cakes</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil for easy clean-up.</li>
        <li>Combine the eggs, mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, Worcestershire, Old Bay, salt, celery, and parsley in a large bowl and mix well. Add the crab meat (be sure to check the meat for any hard and sharp cartilage) and panko; using a rubber spatula, gently fold the mixture together until just combined, being careful not to shred the crab meat. Shape into 6 cakes (each about ½ cup) and place on the prepared baking sheet. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. This helps them set.</li>
        <li>Preheat a large nonstick pan over medium heat and coat with oil. When the oil is hot, place the crab cakes in the pan and cook until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Be careful as oil may splatter. Serve the crab cakes warm with the tartar sauce.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>For the sauce</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, relish, mustard, onion, and lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Cover and chill until ready to serve.</li>
    </ol>

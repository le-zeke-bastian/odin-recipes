    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups DeLallo Whole-Milk Ricotta</li>
        <li>2 cups fresh spinach, finely chopped</li>
        <li>4 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano</li>
        <li>A pinch freshly grated nutmeg</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Homemade Pasta Dough</li>
        <li>DeLallo Pomodoro Fresco Marinara Sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To create the filling, combine all the ingredients in a large mixing bowl using only half of the Parmigiano.</li>
        <li>On a floured surface, divide your dough into 4 equal pieces. Keep the rest of the dough covered in a bowl under a damp kitchen towel to prevent drying out.</li>
        <li>Roll out dough thinly into a long rectangular shape. Using a dough-cutter wheel, cut 2 long rectangular strips of equal size, about 3 inches wide. Working quickly, spoon a rounded teaspoon onto the dough. Do this about 2 inches apart along the pasta sheet. Place the other dough rectangle on top, lining up the edges as best as you can. Press lightly along the edges.</li>
        <li>Using the wheel cutter, first trim off the 4 sides of the rectangle. Next, cut out each square to form ravioli. Seal each with your fingers. To prevent sticking, place finished pasta on a well floured tray.</li>
        <li>Continue this process, preparing as many ravioli as you can, balancing the amount of filling with the remaining dough.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Once boiling, add the ravioli one by one. Stirring them gently to prevent sticking, cook for about 8 minutes. Drain and add hot ravioli to a saucepan with DeLallo Pomodoro Fresco Marinara Sauce.</li>
